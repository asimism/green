All Questions are in json data format in data/questions.json. 

All Category related information is in json format in data/results.json. 

Using Json data files you can change questions, number of aswers, categories and category image,title description. 

I have implemented it as a slider where each question appears in a single slide and once the user chooses an option it will automatically slide to next question. Once all questions are answered it will automatically show the result. User can also navigate between question using left/right arrows.

Note: Question/Category information will be different from what we have on https://www.buzzfeed.com/chiaramilford/which-greenpeace-campaign-are-you-11u5o

Keyboard accessibility: User can use tab key to navigate between answers and can select an answer with enter key. To navigate between question user can user left/right arrow keys.
